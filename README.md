# Tiny Docs

## What is Tiny Docs
Tiny Docs is a simple and lightweight (single file!) documentation template that allows you to write documentation in markdown and have it rendered as a static site

## Feature

- 📄 **Single file** - Just one HTML file!
- 📝 **Markdown** - Write documentation in [markdown](?page=snarkdown)
- 📦 **Zero dependencies** - No need for a build step or package manager. (Although there are tools to make it even smaller)
- 🎨 **Customizable** - Change the CSS to fit your style
- 📱 **Responsive** - Works on all devices
- 🚀 **Fast** - Loads _extremely_ fast

## Use case

- Personal documentation
- Project documentation
- Software documentation
- _Anything_ that needs documentation
I made this because I wanted a simple way to write documentation and have it in a single file. I hope you find it useful!
